      <p>A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.Meals are generally served 
        and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. 
        Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models
         ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced 
         luxury establishments.</p>
         <p>The word derives from early 19th century from French word restaurer 'provide food for', literally 'restore to a former state'[3] 
            and, being the present participle of the verb,[4] The term restaurant may have been used in 1507 as a "restorative
             beverage", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean 'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'.[5]</p>

    A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It served only one dish, a plate of cereal,
       wild fowl, and onions.[6]

        A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat
         food and beverages. 
        These establishments were somewhat comparable to modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens.
         In the Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae.[7]
        
        In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with service counters have been identified throughout the town. They were concentrated along the main axis of the town 
        and the public spaces where they were frequented by the locals.[8]
        
        The Romans also had the popina, a wine bar which in addition to a variety of wines offered a limited selection of simple foods such as olives, bread, cheese,
         stews, sausage, and porridge. The popinae were known as places for the plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society to socialize. While some were confined to 
         one standing room only, others had tables and stools and a few even had couches.[9][10]</pre>
